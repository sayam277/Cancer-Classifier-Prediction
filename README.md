# Introduction
Early detection and accurate classification of cancer cases are critical for effective treatment and improved patient outcomes. This project focuses on developing machine learning models to classify cancer cases based on features such as tumor size, cell characteristics, and patient demographics. By employing various algorithms, the project aims to identify the most effective model for cancer classification.

# Algorithms Used
The following machine learning algorithms are utilized in this project:

Logistic Regression: Used for binary classification, Logistic Regression models the probability of a binary outcome.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): KNN classifies cases based on the majority class of its k nearest neighbors in the feature space.
Decision Trees: Decision Trees split the feature space into regions based on feature values, enabling hierarchical classification.
Random Forests: Random Forests consist of an ensemble of decision trees and aggregate their predictions to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.
Support Vector Machines (SVM): SVM finds the optimal hyperplane that separates classes in the feature space with the maximum margin.
K-Means Clustering (KMC): KMC is an unsupervised learning algorithm used for clustering data points into k clusters based on similarity.
Artificial Neural Networks (ANN): ANN models complex nonlinear relationships between input features and output classes using interconnected layers of neurons.
